# NATURAL DISASTER TRACK:Fairytail
VR is a computer technology that creates a simulated environment for a user. VR places the user right inside the experience itself. Think of it like replacing your entire reality with a virtual one which you can interact with by the help of VR concept.
By replacing our reality with a virtual one, it positions us better to understand real world problems and solve them. So our problem statement targets two main problems faced by the Organisations or Companies while Connecting & recruiting:
1.	Effective Recruitment
2.	Ensuring Employees Safety
# Problem statement 1: Getting right person for a particular job has been a challenge for the Organisations. Once if the candidate confirms & starts to work too in starting with all the interest, pretty well only to figure out later that they either aren’t cut out for it or don’t find it challenging enough and leave. Premature resignations like these hurt a business’s retention efforts. Business try keeping their employees by old tricks like giving health benefits and other onboarding programs. But these don’t guarantee the employees retention. Other reasons why may employees quit early include the following:
•	They realize that they don’t like the work environment
•	The job description didn’t reflect the work they have been doing
•	The job wasn’t exciting enough
# Problem statement 2: As after employees are shortlisted and become regular, they face some other issues in which the most common in market is safety of employees from accidental and health issues. For businesses that send employees off on the fields to work in hazardous conditions, safety is a top priority. However, accidents still happen and fatality rates in certain industries remain high. In dangerous worksites like oil rigs, for example, regular safety briefings and drills may keep workers aware of the potential dangers of their jobs but they still find themselves ill prepared to act when things really do turn out for the worst.
Solution: How can VR help in this regard? By providing promising candidates a virtual workspace that will help them experience their roles before they actively participate in it and can also be used as for training purposes for trainee/Employee. This workspace just not would end here but can also be extended in order to help the employees in their safety in by making a virtual workspace of the office or meeting room. People who are injured and aren’t able to come to office, can work through the virtual workspace by experiencing the real-life office scenario. In order to know the Identity of the employee and creating Th workspace, we will be using the concept of AI, and image processing to identify employees identity and creating characters.
There are already communities like Mozilla and organizations out there using this concept but they have some limits. Our attempt is to make our workspace more identical , Interactive & try crossing those limits.

# Software's used: A-Frame( Mozilla supported and running platform )

# Future-Scope:
Using IBM WATSON services like computer visioning and virtual reality speech sandbox and other VR related services to upgade our platform not just for industrial and business aspects but also to different fields like in natural disaster management & educational line too.

# Instructions to Run:
